1.  `touch server.js` - create a server.js file
2.  `npm init -y` - command to create package.json and auto populate
3.  change all `server.js` to  `server.mjs` in dir & papckage.json
4.  **optional** Install nodemon locally, if not installed globally `npm i --save-dev nodemon`
5.  Create nodemon start script in package.json `"dev": "nodemon server.js"`
